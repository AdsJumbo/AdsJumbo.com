# Monetize with AdsJumbo Ads
Increase your revenue opportunities by putting ads in your apps by using the AdsJumbo Advertising SDK. Our monetization platform offers a variety of ad types including banner ads, interstitial ads and native ads. Drive advertising revenue by choosing from a variety of ad formats that can be seamlessly integrated into your Windows apps and games. Our advertising SDK you can simply implement into your existing Windows 10 & UWP application or game (also Unity 3D game). </br></br>
Supported architecture x86, x64, ARM and .NET platform

# Ad Formats:
# 1. Banner Ads
These are static display ads that utilize a portion of a page in an app or web site. These are typically located at the top, left or bottom of your primary content and prompt the users to install some apps or view brands or products. This is still the most popular ad format in the industry today.
# 2. Interstitial Ads
These are full-screen ads that typically require the user to click through to continue with the app or the game. These generate more user engagement than standard banner ads and hence generate more ad revenue.

# 3. Native Ads
These are component-based ads - each piece of the advertiser's creative - is delivered to the app or web page as individual elements that you can choose to stitch into your page in any manner that fits your scenario the best. You can generate an ad creative optimizing on the style, look and feel and behavior to be very similar to the rest of your app screen or page in order to keep the most unobtrusive end user experience.

# ‚ùì FAQ:
How much time will it take to implement the SDK?</br>
- Implementation usually takes 3-5 minutes. It's very easy and simple even for beginners.</br>

Why I must add content URI in "Package.appxmanifest"?</br>
- This is only needed for the interstitial unit, to invoke event "close ad". This value allows you to close the interstitial ad. If you don't want to use it in your app, you don't have to, but then you won't be able to use interstitial ads thus only banner ads</br>

When are available "live" ads?</br>
- Live ads are available after approval your app or game. Just add your app, hit the button "submit to review", this is routine check by our QA team. If you have any problems with SDK implementation or any questions do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:info@adsjumbo.com"> contact us.</a></br>

Is there any exclusivity ?</br>
- Definitely no! It is always up to what you to decide. You can use more ad providers at the same time to increase your earnings. With us there is no condition of exclusivity. Your satisfaction is always important.</br>

Can I use more ad units on same page / app?</br>
- Yes, definitely. You can use multiple ad units on a page / app. At the same time, We recommend using at least one interstitial ad for better performance in term if revenue.
